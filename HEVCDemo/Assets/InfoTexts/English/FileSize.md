* video file size without any compression is extremely huge
* if video sequence has bitrate 25 frames per seconds (FPS) and size of one frame (image) is 1MB, total size of 1 minute video sequence is 1500MB (1.5GB)
* video compression uses techniques to significantly reduces file size
* __H.264__ encoded 1 minute video can be of the size 40MB (using bitrate 10Mbps)
* H.265 is even more effective, so it can use just 5Mbps bitrate (preserving the same quality) which results in only 20MB file size!
