* HEVC/H.265 is a software for coding video - **video codec**
* video codec has two parts - **encoder** and **decoder**
* on the encoder input, there is a full size video file without compression (see info dialogs about file size)
* encoder uses several techniques (see info dialogs in view options) to besides encoding also compress the video
* encoder produces encoded and compressed video file of smaller size
* decoder ensures reconstruction of image informations from encoded file
* by selecting proper parameters, which affects compression ratio, difference between original and compressed video will be indistinguishable for human eye
