- video file size without any compression is extremely huge
- if video sequence has bitrate 30 frames per seconds and size of 1 frame(image) is 1MB,
  total size of 1 minute video sequence is 1800MB (1.8GB)
- video compression uses techniques to significantly reduces file size
- H.264 encoded 1 minute video can be of the size 40MB (using bitrate 10Mbps)
- H.265 is even more effective, so it can use just 5Mbps bitrate (preserving the same quality) which results in only 20MB file size!
