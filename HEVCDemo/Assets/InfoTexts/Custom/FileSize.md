* video file without any compression is extremely huge
* if video sequence has bitrate 25 frames per seconds (FPS) and size of one frame (image) is 1 MB, total size of 1 minute video sequence is 1500 MB (1.5 GB)
* video compression uses techniques to significantly reduces file size
* __H.264__ encoded 1 minute video can be of the size 64 MB (using optimal bitrate 8.5 Mbps)
* H.265 is even more effective, so it can use just 4.5 Mbps bitrate (preserving the same quality) which results in only 34 MB file size!
